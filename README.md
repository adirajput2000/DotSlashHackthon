# DotSlashHackthon

Introduction:

I am Aditya tomar currently pursuing an online degree from IIT Madras in Programming and Data Science and along that i am also pursuing my Master of Science from SVNIT Surat.
I like to code from starting. I have good experience in Coding. I have knowledge of different languages and concepts like C++, C, Java, MySql, HTML, CSS, BootStrap, Java Script, Node.js, DSA, Android Studio, Firebase, Python along with Numpy and Pandas and basic of Machine Learning.


Project Name -  Bus Track War
Problem - Hack for Smart Cities


Tech & Skills
  1. Android Studio
  2. Java
  3. XML for Fronted
  4. Firebase Integration for Database
  5. Google Map API 
  6. Machine Learning Kit
 
 About the Project:
 
 Here, I created an application to Track the live location for the bus so that everyone can see the live location of bus and fix their schedule according to that.
 
 This project have basically two application, one of them is for Driver and other one is for Passenger.
 
 It's difficult for us to built or gps to every bus and locate the location
 So to overcome this problem, here we come to use the location of the driver phone.
 Here we take the last location of driver in the form of longitude and latitute and store it in realtime Firebase Database. This will happen continously in every four second automatically.
 
 Here in database we have the longitute and latitude of the bus which update continously so by read this data we can show this position in the map of passenger. So Here, we just read that data of longitute and latitude from the database and continously update it in passenger app also. 
 
 Along with that, here we use the API code of google to find the distance in metre between two points and we know this updation is happened in 4 second. So as we have distance as well as time so we can calculate the speed of the bus.
 
 Along this, i added a lot of feature in it like if driver want to send message to his passengers so he can add this.
 here driver can update the current station so that passenger can take idea of next or last staiton of the bus route.
 
 With this we add the vacent seat option in it so that passengers have an idea that will they get seat in the bus or not
 
 Here i care for bus driver also, that is if he don't want to share its position 
 just simple he can off its shared location.
 
 if you are here, I am expecting you read all above text.
 Thank you
